# Simple-Quiz-App-using-tkinter
A Python Tkinter-based quiz app with 10 multiple-choice questions displayed on separate frames. Provides immediate feedback with correct answers highlighted in blue.

# Quiz Application
This is a simple multiple-choice quiz application built using Python's tkinter module. The quiz consists of ten questions on various topics, and the user selects one of the provided options for each question. The application will display a message indicating whether the user's answer was correct or not.

# Usage
To use the quiz application, simply run the main() function in your Python environment. The questions and answer choices are hard-coded into the application, but you can modify them by changing the code in the main() function.

# Dependencies
This application requires the tkinter module, which should be included in most Python distributions. If you are using Python 2, you may need to install the module separately.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge that this project was completed during my first semester as a student in the Programming Fundamentals course at the NED University of Engineering and Technology. This project provided me with an opportunity to develop my skills in Python programming and apply my knowledge to a real-world application.
